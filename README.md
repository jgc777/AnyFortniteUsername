## Tutorial
> See it on the web

1. Go to [your EpicGames account settings](https://epicgames.com/account)
2. <button onclick="const character = 'ﱞ';if (navigator.clipboard.writeText) navigator.clipboard.writeText(character).then(() => alert('Copied!'));else alert('Clipboard API is not supported or is blocked by the browser.');">Copy</button> [this character](https://pastebin.com/raw/DehYde2m)
3. Change your username to the one you want and paste the character more than once in some parts of it (For example: `jﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞgc988ﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞ4`)
4. Your username will show without that character ingame (not on the EpicGames Launcher, etc.)
